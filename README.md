This project was to create a Deep Neural Network that would be trained and predict on the Rossmann store sales datasets, for a Kaggle competition. This work isn't entirely my own, but includes my contributions to the group work. After testing a few types of Deep Neural Network, we decided on using an Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which yielded us the best results.
