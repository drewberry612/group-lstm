# üè¨ Rossmann Store Sales Prediction

This project involved creating a **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** to predict sales for the **Rossmann store sales dataset**, as part of a **Kaggle competition**. While this work is not entirely my own, I contributed significantly to the group effort.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **Model Selection**: After testing various types of **Deep Neural Networks**, the group decided on using an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** network. This model was selected due to its ability to capture sequential dependencies in time-series data, which yielded the best results for our predictions.

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to optimise the model's performance.

- **Training**: The LSTM model was trained on the processed data, optimised to predict the sales for each store. Hyperparameters were fine-tuned for best performance.

## üìä Results

- The LSTM network provided **optimal performance** compared to other types of neural networks tested.

*Note: This is a group project, and my contributions were focused on model selection, preprocessing, and optimisation.*
